Introduction
============

The ``camps`` is a python package for disease modelling in refugee and
internally displaces people settlements. The package is based on the
`JUNE <https://github.com/IDAS-Durham/JUNE>`_ package - a framework for
agent-based modelling.

The current version of ``camps`` is set up to model the Cox's Bazar
refugee settlement in Bangladesh by default, however, can simply be
modified to other settings as necessary.

This documentation is designed to give an overview of the code in the
``camps`` package, with only limited documentation of the JUNE
framework code - leaving this to the JUNE code itself to be
documented.

Details of the use of this package are presened in our `paper
<https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009360>`_.
