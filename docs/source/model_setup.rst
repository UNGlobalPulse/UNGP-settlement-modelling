Model Setup
===========

Geography
---------

``JUNE`` operates on a three-tiered geographical hierarchy:
1. Regions: the highest level
2. Super areas: the middle level
3. Areas: the lowest level

As an example, in the case of the Cox's Bazar settlement: regions
correspond to the ~20 camps which make up the settlements; super areas
refer to the UNHCR deliniated blocks in whach camp; and areas refer to
the Majhee blocks.

Much of the code handling the creation of the geography is using that
of the ``JUNE`` code. Some modifications have been made to allow for a
simpler input format.

Refer to :ref:`data-geography`.
