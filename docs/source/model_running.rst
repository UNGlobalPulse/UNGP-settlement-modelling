Model Running
=============

The best introduction to running the model (in its default setting of
COVID-19 spread in the Cox's Bazar refugee settlement) is through
following and running the ``Notebooks/quickstart camp.ipynb``
notebook. This notebook also breaks down each stage and explains the process.

Once the data is in the ``camp_data`` folder, this notebook should run
out of the box. Alternatively, a pre-run version is published on the
`repository's GitHub <https://github.com/UNGlobalPulse/UNGP-settlement-modelling/blob/master/Notebooks/quickstart%20camp.ipynb>`_.

Scripts

TODO:
- Develop simple script run through larger yaml file
- Document how to use runner script
